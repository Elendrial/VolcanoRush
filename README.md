# VolcanoRush
A 2D game heavily based on Miner Disturbance (web vers) by Jagex - WIP

Most of the core game has been made, but here's what's left:
- Improve movement
- Improve the main menu to include instructions etc
- Monsters
- The rest of the items
- Reduce visibility
- Forced end to game (volcano erupting)
- Proper explosions
- Redo all art
- Rewrite a lot of code to use events & listeners (low priority)

Other:
- I tried to make the code organised, but it seems it's made it more of a mess. Sorry to those who look through it.
