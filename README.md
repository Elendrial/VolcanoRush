# VolcanoRush
A 2D game heavily based on Miner Disturbance (web vers) by Jagex - WIP
Put on hold for the moment, unsure if I'll ever return to it.

Most of the core game has been made, but here's what's left:
- Improve movement (might have to change engine for this)
- Improve the main menu to include instructions etc
- Make a digging cooldown
- Monsters
- The rest of the items
- Forced end to game (volcano erupting)
- Proper explosions
- Redo all art
- Fix that one rare bug where it hangs on generation.
- Rewrite a lot of code to use events & listeners (very low priority)
- Make Dynamite give off light.

Possible ideas:
- Add inventory system
- Add more things giving off light


Other:
- I tried to make the code organised, but it seems it's made it more of a mess. Sorry to those who look through it.
