# VolcanoRush
A 2D game heavily based on Minor Disturbance (web vers) by Jagex - WIP

Most of the core game has been made, but here's what's left:
- Improve movement
- Improve the main menu to include instructions etc
- Volcano generation
- Monsters
- Items
- Item shop menu
- Reduce visibility
- Ores in rocks
- Forced end to game (volcano erupting)

Other:
- I tried to make the code organised, but it seems it's made it more of a mess. Sorry to those who look through it.
